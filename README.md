What is [dotFile](http://linux.about.com/cs/linux101/g/dot_file.htm "dotFile")

Experienced unix users use commandline tool as his knife, and gun on the field. As one of them, I will be dead without
my handy weapon.

Installation
----------
```terminal
git clone git@github.com:nXqd/dotFiles.git ~/.dotFiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```

OSX
---
1. `.\.osx` to config some settings in mac osx. You can read the file for more information.

TODO
----
1. Make a better document for the current vim.
2. Make this work cross platform.

Feel free to post issues and ideas to make this better.
