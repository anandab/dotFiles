What is [dotFile](http://linux.about.com/cs/linux101/g/dot_file.htm "dotFile")

Once it is your knife,

This repo focus mostly on Archlinux and OSX. The other distros may need some tweaks to make it work since they are unix.


Installation
----------
```terminal
git clone git@github.com:nXqd/dotFiles.git ~/.dotFiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake
```

OSX
---
1. `.\.osx` to config some settings in mac osx. You can read the file for more information.

TODO
----
1. Need another sync script. The rsync way which is being used still leave the un needed files behind.

Feel free to post issues and ideas to make this better.
